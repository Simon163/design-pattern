The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a design pattern which creates a chain of objects, where each object has the opportunity to handle a particular request without the client needing to know which specific object handled the request. This pattern enhances the system's flexibility, making it easier to extend and maintain by distributing the responsibility of handling requests among multiple objects, thereby reducing direct coupling between objects.
