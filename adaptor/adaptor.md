The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern used to convert an existing interface into another interface that the caller expects. The Adapter Pattern allows a specific API interface to adapt to multiple scenarios.

An adapter is a special class that can extend or adapt the functionality of specific API interfaces, making these interfaces applicable to more objects or data types.

The adapter encapsulates the adaptation process, thereby hiding the adaptation details, and only provides the adapted API interface to the outside world.
